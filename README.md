# IMDB Movies Data: Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing

## <ins>Summary</ins>

We have datasets from IMDB containing movie data from the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries (up to 2023). Additionally, we have datasets covering genres, ratings, actors, and writers. This project focuses on pre-processing the data using Python, making it ready for advanced analysis. The cleaned dataset is primed for use in advanced analytics and insights.


## <ins>Key Details</ins>

**Dataset Size**: Processed a large, messy dataset containing 178,617 rows of movie data.

**Duplicates & Missing Values**: Identified and handled duplicates and missing entries to ensure data integrity.

**Runtime Standardization**: Unified varying formats of runtime for consistency.

**Numerical Parsing**: Extracted numerical data (e.g., awards, nominations) from text fields for numeric analysis.

**Additional Dataset Cleaning**: Cleaned supplementary datasets such as genres, ratings, actors, and writers. These can be seamlessly joined with the main movies dataset to supplement the analysis.

**Efficiency Upgrades**: Optimized code for better performance, reducing runtime and improving scalability.
