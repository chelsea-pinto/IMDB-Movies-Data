# IMDB Movies Data: Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing

### Summary

We have datasets from IMDB containing movie data spanning the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries (up to 20XX). Additionally, we have datasets covering genres, ratings, actors, and writers. This project focuses on pre-processing the data using Python, making it ready for advanced analysis. The cleaned dataset is primed for use in deeper insights and analytics.
